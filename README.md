The standard Rubik's Cube is a 3x3x3 cube, meaning it has three layers of cubies (small cubes) along each of its three dimensions. Each face of the cube is composed of a 3x3 grid of these cubies, resulting in 9 cubies per face and a total of 54 visible stickers.

In addition to the standard 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube, there are other variations with different dimensions, such as:

- **2x2x2**: Known as the Pocket Cube or Mini Cube.
- **4x4x4**: Known as the Rubik's Revenge.
- **5x5x5**: Known as the Professor's Cube.
- **6x6x6**: Known as the V-Cube 6.
- **7x7x7**: Known as the V-Cube 7.

There are even larger cubes and other variants with different shapes and solving mechanisms, but the 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube is the most widely recognized and commonly used.
